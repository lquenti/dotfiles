Also, since I changed some of the Code and didn't want to do some cryptic git submodule, here the awesome-libs I'm currently using:

- [battery-widget](https://github.com/deficient/battery-widget)
- [brightness](https://github.com/deficient/brightness)
- [volume-control](https://github.com/deficient/volume-control)
