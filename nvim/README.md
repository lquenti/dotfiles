# My NVIM Config!

## Requirements

- [Some not-too-old neovim version, snap probably also works](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
- [Requires vim-plug to be installed manualy](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
- [A Nerd Font for the devicons	](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
- [node for LSP-Support. I recommend nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

## How to install

- Copy the `nvim` Folder to `~/.config/nvim`
- Install all requirements, make sure node is in `$PATH`
- start vim, run `:PlugInstall`
- All Plugins and LSPs will now install, have fun!
